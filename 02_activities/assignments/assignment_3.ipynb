    "Since clustering algorithms rely on distance calculations, features with larger scales can dominate the process if they are not standardized. This can result in biased clustering, where certain features disproportionately influence the outcome. Standardizing ensures that all features are on a similar scale, typically with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, so they contribute equally to the analysis. Without standardization, the algorithm might give undue weight to features with larger numerical ranges, skewing the clustering results."
